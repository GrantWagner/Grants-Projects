  Folder Pattern
    Files are sorted by default using a tokenized case-insitive alpha numeric sort.
    Generally only the "most recent" version will have icons and show up in search
    General security concepts:
      A given application should only access internal files by:
        /Users/{Username}/AppSettings/{Name}/{Version}, rw access
        /Applications/{Name}/{Version}, r access
      Using a file browser dialog gives much more access. Can read and write in:
        /Users/{Username}
        /Shared
        /Mount
      And read anywhere.
      Special case: Installation can only insert files to /Applications/{Name}/{Version}
      Special case: OS Drive mounts can only write new directories in /Mount
      Maybe a sudo command?
    simple strings are explicit folders
    {} enclosed are folder name patterns
    [] enclosed are file name patterns
    () enclosed are general notes
