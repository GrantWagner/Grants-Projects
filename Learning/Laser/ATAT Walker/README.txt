# Summary

Firstly... KUDOS to the amazing work of BillyMcCoy. Fantastic model and a lot of fun to build.
Ive built a few of these and never really liked the idea of gluing the joints. So i redesigned the joints to include larger holes and other such changes to allow M3x12mm screws and nuts.

Also added a lock part that holds the head onto the cross shaft so it can easily be turned without the head falling off. ** THIS PART MUST BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO ASSEMBLING THE CROSS SHAFT TO THE CROSS PLATE **

Changed the back of the head to include a flange for easier positioning.

Please let me know if you make this and encounter any problems at all!!

Thanks everyone!
