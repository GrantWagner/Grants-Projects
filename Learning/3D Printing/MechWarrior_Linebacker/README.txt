# Summary

Mechwarrior Linebacker!  I modeled this one after the linebacker from Mechwarrior Online.  This model measures 8.6 inches tall, 7.4 inches wide and 5 inches deep. I put my own little touch on it so if you'd like to see something different on it or for it to be scaled differently then feel free to make requests. 

You'll need to print (1) of everything PLUS (2) of the Knee Joints.  Everything should fit together and rotate but more than likely you'll need glue to hold it together tight.  Please let me know if you have any problems printing!
