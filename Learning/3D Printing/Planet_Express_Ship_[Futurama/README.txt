# Summary

Edit: I've added a stand for the ship due to a high number of requests. :)

I'm back with another 3D design for you, and this time we're making the Planet Express Ship! As a long time fan of Futurama, I'm really excited about this model. I broke it up into a few pieces so it's easier to print. But unfortunately that makes it pretty hard to scale. I would say scaling down much won't be possible due to the size of some of the details, but scaling up should be okay, you might just need to adjust the pin sizes to fit the tolerances better.

I modeled this in Fusion 360 (link: http://autode.sk/1s0ABZA) using the sculpting and sketch tools available there. Then I sliced it in Simplify3D (settings below) and printed it out on my Robo3D R1. I used white Hatchbox PLA. Then my wife sanded, glued and painted the entire thing using an airbrush and paintbrushes.

Print Settings:
Layer Height: 0.3mm (0.1 on the tail with the logo)
Infill: 15%
Supports: Yes
Raft: Yes
